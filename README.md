# Mindow

If you initialize a Mindow with this package, you will get a simple Jframe with a Drawable JPanel associated with it.
Create a subclass from the Drawer class to draw onto the Mindow for code cleanliness.

Got tired of recreating the Mindow class every time I wanted a Mindow.
If you want to create a Mindow but don't know how, just use Mindow.defaultMindow() to get a default Mindow.
